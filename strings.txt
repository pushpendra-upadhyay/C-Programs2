STRINGS
strings - These are collection of characters in a continous fashion terminated by a null character.
TAKING INPUT IN STRING
we can input in a string using the following methodes-
SCANF- scanf("%s",str)
In the following format the space acts as a delimitter which means the input will be terminated if we press space.
SCANF("%[^\n]s",str);
In the above format the scanf in modified such that new line act as a delimitter.
GETS(str);
The gets function belongs to stdio.h and it is dedicated function for string input.The new line acts as a delimitter for gets function. 
It is to be noted that gets does not perform any array boundary checking which usally reserves in buffer overflow.
FGETS("str,len,stdin");
Fgets is a dedicated function for a string input. It belongs to stdio.h header file.
The delimitter for fgtes is- 
1.New line
2.End a line
3.End of limit
NOTE: The fgets perform arrray boundary checking thus it is the best way to take input in a string.
